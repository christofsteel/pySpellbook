Chances are, that you \r\ndo not know all your spells and effects by heart. This software lets you \r\nchoose a selection of spells and generate a pdf version of the spellbook.\r\n\r\nIn addition you can browse and filter your spell library by class, rulebook,\r\nschool/subschool, descriptor and fulltextsearch.\r\n\r\n## How to install?\r\nIf you are on linux and have python 3 and pip installed, then install it\r\nvia\r\n\r\n\tpip install pySpellbook\r\n\r\nthis will fetch all python dependencies and install the binary pySpellbook.\r\n\r\nFor windows releases there is an installer in \"Releases\"\r\n\r\npySpellbook uses Prince to render the pdf output. Unfortunately Prince  is\r\nnot open source software, but free for personal use. To install prince \r\ndownload it here (http://www.princexml.com/download/) and set the correct \r\npath in pySpellbooks \"Config export...\" dialog.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want to use Prince, you can use an internal renderer or \r\nprint the intermediate html with your favourite browser (Firefox recommended),\r\nbut those have serious drawbacks in terms of support for printed media css.\r\n\r\n## How to add spells?\r\nEither by [hand] (https://github.com/christofsteel/pySpellbook/wiki/generateDatasets), or import a dataset available here:\r\n\r\n* Pathfinder PRD [Download] (https://github.com/christofsteel/pySpellbook/releases/download/v0.7.2/pathfinder.json)\r\n* Pathfinder DPRD \\[German\\] (to be added)\r\n* D&D 3.5 SRD (to be added)\r\n\r\n## Licenses\r\nThe text of every license can be found under LICENSES.\r\n * PySpellbook (c) 2015 Christoph Stahl is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n * The font \"Humanitic\" (c) 1998 by George Williams is licensed under the SIL Open Font License.\r\n * Floral Decorations (http://www.freevector.com/floral-decoration-graphics/) (c) artshare.ru licensed under CC BY 3.0\r\n * The \"Pathfinder PRD\" (c) 2002-2015 Paizo, Inc. is licensed under the Open Game License 1.0a.\r\n\r\nSince the windows binary builds also include the libraries used:\r\n * Python 3.4 (c) 2001-2015 Python Software Foundation is licensed under the PSL License\r\n * PySide and Qt (c) 2015 The Qt Company are licensed under the LGPL 2.1\r\n * Appdirs (c) 2010 ActiveState Software Inc. is licensed under the MIT License\r\n * SQLAlchemy (c) 2005-2015 the SQLAlchemy authors and contributors is licensed under the MIT License\r\n * Jinja2 (c) 2009 by the Jinja Team is licensed under the BSD License\r\n * Weasyprint (c) 2011-2014 by Simon Sapin and contributors is licensed under the BSD License\r\n * PyQuery (C) 2008 - Olivier Lauzanne is licensed under the BSD License\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

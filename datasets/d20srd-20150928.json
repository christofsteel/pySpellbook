Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dismissible.\n\n\tRegardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature\u2019s name, identity, or <a href=\"/srd/description.htm#alignment\">alignment</a> but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don\u2019t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed.

Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.\nChaining\n\tThe subject is confined by restraints that generate an <a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/antipathy.htm\">antipathy</a> spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.\nSlumber\n\tThis version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell\u2019s save DC by 1.\nBound Slumber\n\tThis combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.\nHedged Prison\n\tThe subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.\nMetamorphosis\n\tThe subject assumes <a href=\"/srd/specialAbilities.htm#gaseousForm\">gaseous form</a>, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\nMinimus Containment\n\tThe subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\n\n\tYou can\u2019t dispel a binding spell with <a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/dispelMagic.htm\">dispel magic</a> or a similar effect, though an <a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/antimagicField.htm\">antimagic field</a> or <a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/magesDisjunction.htm\">Mage\u2019s disjunction</a> affects it normally.

These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals, soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like\n\n\tIn addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.\n", "descriptors": "Mind-Affecting", "name": "Binding", "system": "D&D 3.5", "save": "Will negates; see text", "subschool": "Compulsion", "school": "Enchantment", "cast_time": "One minute", "duration": "See text (D)", "target": "One living creature", "range": "Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)"}, {"spell_res": "No", "somatic": true, "rulebook": "D20SRD", "verbal": true, "material": true, "classes": [["Sorcerer", 4], ["Wizard", 4]], "descriptors": null, "name": "Black Tentacles", "system": "D&D 3.5", "save": "None", "subschool": "Creation", "school": "Conjuration", "cast_time": "1 standard action", "area": "20-ft.-radius spread", "duration": "1 round/level (D)", "text": "\n\tThis spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long.

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.\n\n\tSecond, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate.\n\n\tThe gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster\u2019s choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.\n\n\tA gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.\nPlanar Travel\n\tAs a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a <a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/planeShift.htm\">plane shift</a> spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you\u2014anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.\n\n\tYou may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.\nCalling Creatures\n\tThe second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no <a href=\"/srd/specialAbilities.htm#charmAndCompulsion\">compulsion</a> to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).\n\n\tIf you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can\u2019t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.\n\n\tA controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature\u2019s help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.\n\n\tIf you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/planarAllyLesser.htm\">lesser planar ally</a> spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in \u201clivestock\u201d rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.\n\n\tFailure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least.

When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points\u2019 worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.\n\n\tUntil it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.\n\n\tAs a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can\u2019t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death\u2019s triggering conditions cannot be changed.\n\n\tIn this case, \u201creading\u201d the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can\u2019t use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\n\n\tYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature\u2019s name, identity, or <a href=\"/srd/description.htm#alignment\">alignment</a>, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don\u2019t qualify.\n\n\tWhen scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune\u2019s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\n\n\tYou also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\n\n\t<a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/readMagic.htm\">Read magic</a> allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 <a href=\"/srd/skills/spellcraft.htm\">Spellcraft</a> check. Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\n\n\tA symbol of death can be removed by a successful <a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/dispelMagic.htm\">dispel magic</a> targeted solely on the rune. An <a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/erase.htm\">erase</a> spell has no effect on a symbol of death. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.\n\n\tSymbol of death can be made permanent with a <a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/permanency.htm\">permanency</a> spell. A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.\n\n\t<em>Note:</em> Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.

Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. <em>Note:</em> An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</li>\n\t<li>Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all <a href=\"/srd/specialAbilities.htm#poison\">poison</a> effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.</li>\n\t<li>Revive the dead. A wish can bring a <a href=\"/srd/conditionSummary.htm#dead\">dead</a> creature back to life by duplicating a <a class=\"spell\" href=\"/srd/spells/resurrection.htm\">resurrection</a> spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.</li>\n\t<li>Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a <a href=\"/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#will\">Will save</a> to negate the effect, and <a href=\"/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellResistance\">spell resistance</a> (if any) applies.</li>\n\t<li>Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent\u2019s successful save, a foe\u2019s successful <a href=\"/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#criticalHits\">critical hit</a> (either the <a href=\"/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll\">attack roll</a> or the critical roll), a friend\u2019s failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a <a href=\"/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#will\">Will save</a> to negate the effect, and <a href=\"/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellResistance\">spell resistance</a> (if any) applies.</li>\n\n\tYou may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous.

When a wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more.

The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.\n</p><i>Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel</i><p>\n\tThe spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.\n</p><i>Cliffs</i><p>\n\tEarthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).\n</p><i>Open Ground</i><p>\n\tEach creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.\n</p><i>Structure</i><p>\n\tAny structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).\n</p><i>River, Lake, or Marsh</i><p>\n\tFissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.\n</p><i>Pinned beneath Rubble</i><p>\n\tAny creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.\n</p>", "name": "Earthquake", "range": "Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)", "divine_focus": true, "somatic": true, "classes": [["Cleric", 8], ["Druid", 8]], "rulebook": "D20SRD", "school": "Evocation", "area": "80-ft.-radius spread (S)"}, {"subschool": "Summoning", "verbal": true, "spell_res": "No", "duration": "10 min./level (D)", "system": "SRD 3.5", "descriptors": "see text", "cast_time": "10 minutes", "text": "<p>\n\tThis spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it.

When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle\u2019s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell\u2019s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.\n</p><p>\n\tA magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature\u2019s extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\n</p><p>\n\tYou can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\n</p><p>\n\tA successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram\u2014even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.\n</p><p>\n\tThis spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.\n</p><i>Arcane Material Component</i><p>\n\tA little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.\n</p>", "name": "Magic Circle against Evil", "range": "Touch", "divine_focus": true, "somatic": true, "classes": [["Wizard", 3]], "rulebook": "D20SRD", "school": "Abjuration", "area": "10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature"}, {"name": "Magic Circle against Good", "subschool": null, "system": "SRD 3.5", "descriptors": "Evil", "classes": [["Cleric", 3]], "rulebook": "D20SRD", "school": "Abjuration", "text": "<p>\n\tThis spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from good instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.\n</p>"}, {"name": "Magic Circle against Good", "subschool": null, "system": "SRD 3.5", "descriptors": "Evil", "classes": [["Sorcerer", 3]], "rulebook": "D20SRD", "school": "Abjuration", "text": "<p>\n\tThis spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from good instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.\n</p>"}, {"name": "Magic Circle against Good", "subschool": null, "system": "SRD 3.5", "descriptors": "Evil", "classes": [["Wizard", 3]], "rulebook": "D20SRD", "school": "Abjuration", "text": "<p>\n\tThis spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from good instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.\n</p>"}, {"name": "Magic Circle against Law", "subschool": null, "system": "SRD 3.5", "descriptors": "Chaotic", "classes": [["Cleric", 3]], "rulebook": "D20SRD", "school": "Abjuration", "text": "<p>\n\tThis spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from law instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.\n</p>"}, {"name": "Magic Circle against Law", "subschool": null, "system": "SRD 3.5", "descriptors": "Chaotic", "classes": [["Sorcerer", 3]], "rulebook": "D20SRD", "school": "Abjuration", "text": "<p>\n\tThis spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from law instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.\n</p>"}, {"name": "Magic Circle against Law", "subschool": null, "system": "SRD 3.5", "descriptors": "Chaotic", "classes": [["Wizard", 3]], "rulebook": "D20SRD", "school": "Abjuration", "text": "<p>\n\tThis spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from law instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.\n</p>"}, {"subschool": null, "verbal": true, "spell_res": "Yes (harmless)", "duration": "1 min./level", "system": "SRD 3.5", "save": "Will negates (harmless)", "descriptors": null, "cast_time": "1 standard action", "text": "<p>\n\tMagic fang gives one natural weapon of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls.

As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon.

When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points\u2019 worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.\n</p><p>\n\tUntil it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.\n</p><p>\n\tAs a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can\u2019t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death\u2019s triggering conditions cannot be changed.\n</p><p>\n\tIn this case, \u201creading\u201d the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can\u2019t use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\n</p><p>\n\tYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature\u2019s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don\u2019t qualify.\n</p><p>\n\tWhen scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune\u2019s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\n</p><p>\n\tYou also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\n</p><p>\n\tRead magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\n</p><p>\n\tA symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.\n</p><p>\n\tSymbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.\n</p><p>\n\t<em>Note:</em> Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.
